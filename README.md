# Sorting

## Selection sort
-Time complexity: O(n^2)

## Quick Sort
-Time complexity: O(n log n) in best case, O(n^2) in worst case <br>
-O(n^2) occurs when the pivot is either the first element or the last element <br>
-O(n log n) occurs when the pivot is the median of first,middle and last element (median of three) <br>
-More commonly used than merge sorts

## Merge Sort
-list of items keeps getting divided by half <br>
-Time Complexity: O(n log n)

# Searching

## Linear Search
- Time complexity: O(n) <br>

## Binary Search
- Time complexity: O(log n) <br>
